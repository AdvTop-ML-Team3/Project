-------- Note -----------

This section contains the [Feature Wise Linear Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12192) applied to the Gated Graph Neural Network and tested on the [PPI (Protein Protein Interaction)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04638) dataset.

Please find a pre-trained model and a screenshot of the corresponding training, for easy replication.

Code Reference:
For a thorough analysis of the performance of a GGNN  enhanced with FiLM on the PPI dataset we have used the original implementation released by Microsoft Research.  The [FiLM extension of the GGNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12192) was proposed and contributed by Marc Brockschmidt (also a co-author of the original GGNN paper). Code reference and thorough documentation of the same is available at:[https://pypi.org/project/tf2-gnn/ ](https://pypi.org/project/tf2-gnn/)
